<h1 id="tentweets">Ten tweets</h1>

<p>Link to project http://tentweets.lofholm.se/app.html</p>

<p>This was a small project I did just to play around with the twitter API. </p>

<p>The &#8220;App&#8221; search Twitter for the 10 latest tweets based on an hashtag that the user specifics. The tweets are then displayed in a list using a kickass CSS3 animation :)</p>

<p>To challenge myself I did’t use any JS frameworks, such as jQuery, and wrote everything in plain JS. The same goes for CSS, even though I used SASS files so I could use imports and autoprefixer. Since you know… nobody likes writing browser prefixes. </p>

<p>The PHP magic is from James Mallison (J7mbo) and is a slightly modified version of the the https://github.com/J7mbo/twitter-api-php project. Thanks for the code!</p>

<p>Since this was more of a educational project and I wanted to use modern web technologies (HTML5, CSS3, ES5, Inline SVG) I don’t have full support for legacy browsers.</p>
